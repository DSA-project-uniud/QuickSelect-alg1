# QuickSelect-alg1
Quick Select is a variation of the quicksort algorithm. It is an optimized way to find the kth smallest/largest element in an unsorted array.

# Worst case:
Worst case occurs when we pick the largest/smallest element as pivot.
O(n^2)

# Best case: 
Best case occurs when we partition the list into two halves and continue with only the half we are interested in.
O(n)
